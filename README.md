## European Ski Resorts Analysis ‚õ∞Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

Project Overview

This project explored European ski resorts using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset includes information about various resorts, their elevation, and country distribution. 

The analysis included:  
- Processing clean raw data for meaningful insights  
- Creating compelling visualisations using Matplotlib and Plotly  
- Performing comparative analysis to identify trends and patterns  
- Utilising Python and Pandas for efficient data manipulation  

Key findings include: 
- The highest-elevation resorts in Europe  
- Which ski resorts offer the greatest number and variety of slopes  
- How lift capacity compares to the number of ski slopes  
- Which resorts provide the most value in terms of skiable terrain
