European Ski Resorts Analysis ‚õ∞Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è

Project Overview

This project analyzes European ski resorts using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset includes information about various resorts, their elevation, and country distribution. The analysis provides insights into:

- The highest-elevation resorts in Europe

- Which ski resorts offer the greatest number and variety of slopes

- How lift capacity compares to the number of ski slopes

- Which resorts provide the most value in terms of skiable terrain

I also included some interactive visualizations using Plotly
